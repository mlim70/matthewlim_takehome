                Hey! My name is Matthew Lim, and I’m a second year transfer Computer Science major (from UC Davis). Something I’m passionate about is maintaining mental health, both in myself and others. In highschool, I was part of a peer-intervention suicide prevention program, called Hope Squad, where I learned how to connect peers to mental health resources, recognize warning signs, and take preventative measures. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One takeaway that stuck with me is that a lot of these efforts, regarding mental health and other services in general, consist of making these resources more accessible to the general public; I believe this aligns with BitsofGood’s goals and projects. I continue to do this as Head of Outreach for the crochet/knitting club, to hopefully give back to the community and introduce more people to stress-relief through crafting. 
            </p>
