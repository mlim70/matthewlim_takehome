                        Hey! My name is Matthew Lim, and I’m a second year transfer Computer Science major (from UC Davis). Something I’m passionate about is maintaining mental health, both in myself and others. In highschool, I was part of a peer-intervention suicide prevention program, called Hope Squad, where I learned how to connect peers to mental health resources, recognize warning signs, and take preventative measures. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One takeaway that stuck with me is that improving quality of life has just as much to do with delivery as it does with the creation of services - in every other field just as much as with mental health. With WebDev, I'll streamline access to valuable services to connect people with services, while ensuring the quality of these services through back-end. Currently, I make an effort to connect people to resources as Head of Outreach for the crochet/knitting club, to introduce more people to stress-relief through the fiber arts.
